# Jimoku

Jimoku is a web app that estimates the future occupation of the student gym in St Andrews. 

The estimation is done by a Polynomial Linear regression model. 

The data, to train the model, was parsed from the [Sports Center page](https://sport.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/) of University of St Andrews.
